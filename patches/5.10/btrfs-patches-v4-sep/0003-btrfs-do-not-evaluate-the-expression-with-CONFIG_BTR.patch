Subject: [PATCH 03/36] btrfs: do not evaluate the expression with
 !CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT

While investigating a performance issue I noticed that turning off
CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT had no effect in what I was seeing in perf,
specifically check_setget_bounds() was around 5% for this workload.
Upon investigation I realized that I made a mistake when I added
ASSERT(), I would still evaluate the expression, but simply ignore the
result.

This is useless, and has a marked impact on performance.  This
microbenchmark is the watered down version of an application that is
experiencing performance issues, and does renames and creates over and
over again.  Doing these operations 200k times without this patch takes
13 seconds on my machine.  With this patch it takes 7 seconds.

[HH: removed the second hunk for 5.7.x]
