Subject: [PATCH 2/5] Bluetooth: Fix attempting to set RPA timeout when
 unsupported

During controller initialization, an LE Set RPA Timeout command is sent
to the controller if supported. However, the value checked to determine
if the command is supported is incorrect. Page 1921 of the Bluetooth
Core Spec v5.2 shows that bit 2 of octet 35 of the Supported_Commands
field corresponds to the LE Set RPA Timeout command, but currently
bit 6 of octet 35 is checked. This patch checks the correct value
instead.

This issue led to the error seen in the following btmon output during
initialization of an adapter (rtl8761b) and prevented initialization
from completing.

< HCI Command: LE Set Resolvable Private Address Timeout (0x08|0x002e) plen 2
        Timeout: 900 seconds
> HCI Event: Command Complete (0x0e) plen 4
      LE Set Resolvable Private Address Timeout (0x08|0x002e) ncmd 2
        Status: Unsupported Remote Feature / Unsupported LMP Feature (0x1a)
= Close Index: 00:E0:4C:6B:E5:03

The error did not appear when running with this patch.
