Subject: [PATCH 22/37] btrfs: make flush_space take a enum btrfs_flush_state
 instead of int

I got a automated message from somebody who runs clang against our
kernels and it's because I used the wrong enum type for what I passed
into flush_space.  Change the argument to be explicitly the enum we're
expecting to make everything consistent.  Maybe eventually gcc will
catch errors like this.
