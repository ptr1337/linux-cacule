Subject: [PATCH 02/37] btrfs: restart snapshot delete if we have to end the
 transaction

This is to fully fix the deadlock described in

btrfs: do not resolve backrefs for roots that are being deleted

Holding write locks on our deleted snapshot across trans handles will
just lead to sadness, and our backref lookup code is going to want to
still process dropped snapshots for things like qgroup accounting.

Fix this by simply dropping our path before we restart our transaction,
and picking back up from our drop_progress key.  This is less efficient
obviously, but it also doesn't deadlock, so it feels like a reasonable
trade off.
