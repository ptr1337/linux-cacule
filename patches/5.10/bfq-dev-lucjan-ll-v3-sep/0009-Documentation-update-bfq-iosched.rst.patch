+5. Development version of BFQ
+=============================
+
+The production version of BFQ is available in Linux since 4.12,
+only for the new blk-mq version of the block layer.
+
+The development version of BFQ for a given kernel version differs from
+the production version in that:
+
+- it contains commits not available for that kernel version;
+- it contains a lot of consistency checks to detect possible malfunctions.
+
+Depending on the kernel version, development versions of BFQ are available
+in two different forms in this repository.
+
+First, up to kernels 4.19.X, both the legacy (single-queue) and the blk-mq
+versions of the  block layer were available. And we made BFQ for both
+versions of the block layer. So, to try to reduce confusion,
+in this repo we added these variants of BFQ in the branches based on
+kernels up to 4.19:
+
+- bfq-sq: development version of BFQ for legacy block
+- bfq-mq: development version of BFQ for blk-mq
+
+IOW, up to 4.19, you find three versions of BFQ: the production version,
+named bfq, plus two development versions, named bfq-sq and bfq-mq.
+
+Things change from kernel 5.0 onwards. Since the legacy block layer is
+not available any longer and therefore there can be no bfq-sq.
+Since the production version of bfq lags much less in terms of
+important commits, compared to the development version of bfq,
+the development branches do not contain an additional bfq-mq scheduler,
+but simply the additional commits that turn the production version into the
+development version, leaving the name unchanged.
+IOW, in each branch, there is still only one BFQ, named bfq.
+But this bfq is more powerful and consistency-checked than the production version.
+See Section 4 for details.
