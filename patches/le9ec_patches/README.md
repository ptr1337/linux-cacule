The kernel does not provide a way to protect the [working set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_set) under memory pressure. A certain amount of anonymous and clean file pages is required by the userspace for normal operation. First of all, the userspace needs a cache of shared libraries and executable binaries. If the amount of the clean file pages falls below a certain level, then [thrashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrashing_(computer_science)) and even [livelock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deadlock#Livelock) can take place.

The patch provides sysctl knobs for protecting the working set (anonymous and clean file pages) under memory pressure.

The `vm.anon_min_kbytes` sysctl knob provides *hard* protection of anonymous pages. The anonymous pages on the current node won't be reclaimed under any conditions when their amount is below `vm.anon_min_kbytes`. This knob may be used to prevent excessive swap thrashing when anonymous memory is low (for example, when memory is going to be overfilled by compressed data of zram module).

The `vm.clean_low_kbytes` sysctl knob provides *best-effort* protection of clean file pages. The file pages on the current node won't be reclaimed under memory pressure when the amount of clean file pages is below `vm.clean_low_kbytes` *unless* we threaten to OOM. Protection of clean file pages using this knob may be used when swapping is still possible to
- prevent disk I/O thrashing under memory pressure;
- improve performance in disk cache-bound tasks under memory pressure.

The `vm.clean_min_kbytes` sysctl knob provides *hard* protection of clean file pages. The file pages on the current node won't be reclaimed under memory pressure when the amount of clean file pages is below `vm.clean_min_kbytes`. Hard protection of clean file pages using this knob may be used to
- prevent disk I/O thrashing under memory pressure even with no free swap space;
- improve performance in disk cache-bound tasks under memory pressure;
- avoid high latency and prevent livelock in near-OOM conditions.

`le9ec` patches provide three sysctl knobs (`vm.anon_min_kbytes`, `vm.clean_low_kbytes`, `vm.clean_min_kbytes`) with zero values and does not protect the working set by default (`CONFIG_ANON_MIN_KBYTES=0`, `CONFIG_CLEAN_LOW_KBYTES=0`, `CONFIG_CLEAN_MIN_KBYTES=0`). You can specify other values during kernel build, or change the knob values on the fly.
