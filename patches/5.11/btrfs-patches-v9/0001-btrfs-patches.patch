Subject: [PATCH 01/33] btrfs: add a force_chunk_alloc to space_info's sysfs

In testing various things such as the btrfsck patch to detect over
allocation of chunks, empty block group deletion, and balance I've had
various ways to force chunk allocations for debug purposes.  Add a sysfs
file to enable forcing of chunk allocation for the owning space info in
order to enable us to add testcases in the future to test these various
features easier.

Subject: [PATCH 02/33] btrfs: do not evaluate the expression with
 !CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT

While investigating a performance issue I noticed that turning off
CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT had no effect in what I was seeing in perf,
specifically check_setget_bounds() was around 5% for this workload.
Upon investigation I realized that I made a mistake when I added
ASSERT(), I would still evaluate the expression, but simply ignore the
result.

This is useless, and has a marked impact on performance.  This
microbenchmark is the watered down version of an application that is
experiencing performance issues, and does renames and creates over and
over again.  Doing these operations 200k times without this patch takes
13 seconds on my machine.  With this patch it takes 7 seconds.

Subject: [PATCH 03/33] btrfs: do not block on deleted bgs mutex in the cleaner

While running some stress tests I started getting hung task messages.
This is because the delete unused bg's code has to take the
delete_unused_bgs_mutex to do it's work, which is taken by balance to
make sure we don't delete block groups while we're balancing.

The problem is a balance can take a while, and so we were getting hung
task warnings.  We don't need to block and run these things, and the
cleaner is needed to do other work, so trylock on this mutex and just
bail if we can't acquire it right away.

Subject: [PATCH 04/33] btrfs: only let one thread pre-flush delayed refs in
 commit

I've been running a stress test that runs 20 workers in their own
subvolume, which are running an fsstress instance with 4 threads per
worker, which is 80 total fsstress threads.  In addition to this I'm
running balance in the background as well as creating and deleting
snapshots.  This test takes around 12 hours to run normally, going
slower and slower as the test goes on.

The reason for this is because fsstress is running fsync sometimes, and
because we're messing with block groups we often fall through to
btrfs_commit_transaction, so will often have 20-30 threads all calling
btrfs_commit_transaction at the same time.

These all get stuck contending on the extent tree while they try to run
delayed refs during the initial part of the commit.

This is suboptimal, really because the extent tree is a single point of
failure we only want one thread acting on that tree at once to reduce
lock contention.  Fix this by making the flushing mechanism a bit
operation, to make it easy to use test_and_set_bit() in order to make
sure only one task does this initial flush.

Once we're into the transaction commit we only have one thread doing
delayed ref running, it's just this initial pre-flush that is
problematic.  With this patch my stress test takes around 90 minutes to
run, instead of 12 hours.

Subject: [PATCH 05/33] btrfs: delayed refs pre-flushing should only run the
 heads we have

Previously our delayed ref running used the total number of items as the
items to run.  However we changed that to number of heads to run with
the delayed_refs_rsv, as generally we want to run all of the operations
for one bytenr.

But with btrfs_run_delayed_refs(trans, 0) we set our count to 2x the
number of items that we have.  This is generally fine, but if we have
some operation generation loads of delayed refs while we're doing this
pre-flushing in the transaction commit, we'll just spin forever doing
delayed refs.

Fix this to simply pick the number of delayed refs we currently have,
that way we do not end up doing a lot of extra work that's being
generated in other threads.

Subject: [PATCH 06/33] btrfs: only run delayed refs once before committing

We try to pre-flush the delayed refs when committing, because we want to
do as little work as possible in the critical section of the transaction
commit.

However doing this twice can lead to very long transaction commit delays
as other threads are allowed to continue to generate more delayed refs,
which potentially delays the commit by multiple minutes in very extreme
cases.

So simply stick to one pre-flush, and then continue the rest of the
transaction commit.

Subject: [PATCH 07/33] btrfs: move delayed ref flushing for qgroup into qgroup
 helper

The commit d67263354541 ("btrfs: qgroup: Make snapshot accounting work
with new extent-oriented qgroup.") added a flush of the delayed refs
during snapshot creation in order to get the qgroup accounting properly.
However this code has changed and been moved to it's own helper that is
skipped if qgroups are turned off.  Move the flushing to the helper, as
we do not need it when qgroups are turned off.

Also add a comment explaining why it exists, and why it doesn't actually
save us.  This will be helpful later when we try to fix qgroup
accounting properly.

Subject: [PATCH 08/33] btrfs: remove bogus BUG_ON in alloc_reserved_tree_block

The fix 361048f586f5 ("Btrfs: fix full backref problem when inserting
shared block reference") added a delayed ref flushing at subvolume
creation time in order to avoid hitting this particular BUG_ON().

Before this fix, we were tripping the BUG_ON() by

1. Modify snapshot A, which creates blocks with a normal reference for
   snapshot A, as A is the owner of these blocks.  We now have delayed
   refs for these blocks.
2. Create a snapshot of A named B, which pushes references for the
   children blocks of the root node for the new root B, thus creating
   more delayed refs for newly allocated blocks.
3. A is modified, and because the metadata blocks can now be shared, it
   must push FULL_BACKREF references to the children of any block that A
   cow's down it's path to its target key.
4. Delayed refs are run.  Because these are newly allocated blocks, we
   have ->must_insert_reserved reserved set on the delayed ref head, we
   call into alloc_reserved_tree_block() to add the extent item, and
   then add our ref.  At the time of this fix, we were ordering
   FULL_BACKREF delayed ref operations first, so we'd go to add this
   reference and then BUG_ON() because we didn't have the FULL_BACKREF
   flag set.

The patch fixed this problem by making sure we ran the delayed refs
before we had the chance to modify A.  This meant that any *new* blocks
would have had their extent items created _before_ we would ever
actually cow down and generate FULL_BACKREF entries.  Thus the problem
went away.

However this BUG_ON() is actually completely bogus.  The existence of a
full backref doesn't necessarily mean that FULL_BACKREF must be set on
that block, it must only be set on the actual parent itself.  Consider
the example provided above.  If we cow down one path from A, any nodes
are going to have a FULL_BACKREF ref pushed down to _all_ of their
children, but not all of the children are going to have FULL_BACKREF
set.  It is completely valid to have an extent item with normal and full
back refs without FULL_BACKREF actually set on the block itself.

As a final note, I have been testing with the patch

  btrfs: stop running all delayed refs during snapshot

which removed this flushing.  My test was a torture test which did a lot
of operations while snapshotting and deleting snapshots as well as
relocation, and I never tripped this BUG_ON().  This is actually because
at the time of 361048f586f5, we ordered SHARED keys _before_ normal
references, and thus they would get run first.  However currently they
are ordered _after_ normal references, so we'd do the initial creation
without having a shared reference, and thus not hit this BUG_ON(), which
explains why I didn't start hitting this problem during my testing with
my other patch applied.

Subject: [PATCH 09/33] btrfs: stop running all delayed refs during snapshot

This was added in commit 361048f586f5 ("Btrfs: fix full backref problem
when inserting shared block reference") to address a problem where we
hit the following BUG_ON() in alloc_reserved_tree_block

        if (node->type == BTRFS_SHARED_BLOCK_REF_KEY) {
                BUG_ON(!(flags & BTRFS_BLOCK_FLAG_FULL_BACKREF));

However this BUG_ON() is bogus, and was removed by

  btrfs: remove bogus BUG_ON in alloc_reserved_tree_block

We no longer need to run delayed refs because of this, and can remove
this flushing here.

Subject: [PATCH 10/33] btrfs: run delayed refs less often in
 commit_cowonly_roots

We love running delayed refs in commit_cowonly_roots, but it is a bit
excessive.  I was seeing cases of running 3 or 4 refs a few times in a
row during this time.  Instead simply update all of the roots first,
then run delayed refs, then handle the empty block groups case, and then
if we have any more dirty roots do the whole thing again.  This allows
us to be much more efficient with our delayed ref running, as we can
batch a few more operations at once.

Subject: [PATCH 11/33] btrfs: make flush_space take a enum btrfs_flush_state
 instead of int

I got a automated message from somebody who runs clang against our
kernels and it's because I used the wrong enum type for what I passed
into flush_space.  Change the argument to be explicitly the enum we're
expecting to make everything consistent.  Maybe eventually gcc will
catch errors like this.

Subject: [PATCH 12/33] btrfs: add a trace point for reserve tickets

While debugging a ENOSPC related performance problem I needed to see the
time difference between start and end of a reserve ticket, so add a
trace point to report when we handle a reserve ticket.

I opted to spit out start_ns itself without calculating the difference
because there could be a gap between enabling the tracpoint and setting
start_ns.  Doing it this way allows us to filter on 0 start_ns so we
don't get bogus entries, and we can easily calculate the time difference
with bpftrace or something else.

Subject: [PATCH 13/33] btrfs: track ordered bytes instead of just dio ordered
 bytes

We track dio_bytes because the shrink delalloc code needs to know if we
have more DIO in flight than we have normal buffered IO.  The reason for
this is because we can't "flush" DIO, we have to just wait on the
ordered extents to finish.

However this is true of all ordered extents.  If we have more ordered
space outstanding than dirty pages we should be waiting on ordered
extents.  We already are ok on this front technically, because we always
do a FLUSH_DELALLOC_WAIT loop, but I want to use the ordered counter in
the preemptive flushing code as well, so change this to count all
ordered bytes instead of just DIO ordered bytes.

Sole-y for preemptive flushing, we want to be able to force the
transaction commit without any of the ambiguity of
may_commit_transaction().  This is because may_commit_transaction()
checks tickets and such, and in preemptive flushing we already know
it'll be helpful, so use this to keep the code nice and clean and
straightforward.

Subject: [PATCH 15/33] btrfs: improve preemptive background space flushing

Currently if we ever have to flush space because we do not have enough
we allocate a ticket and attach it to the space_info, and then
systematically flush things in the file system that hold space
reservations until our space is reclaimed.

However this has a latency cost, we must go to sleep and wait for the
flushing to make progress before we are woken up and allowed to continue
doing our work.

In order to address that we used to kick off the async worker to flush
space preemptively, so that we could be reclaiming space hopefully
before any tasks needed to stop and wait for space to reclaim.

When I introduced the ticketed ENOSPC stuff this broke slightly in the
fact that we were using tickets to indicate if we were done flushing.
No tickets, no more flushing.  However this meant that we essentially
never preemptively flushed.  This caused a write performance regression
that Nikolay noticed in an unrelated patch that removed the committing
of the transaction during btrfs_end_transaction.

The behavior that happened pre that patch was btrfs_end_transaction()
would see that we were low on space, and it would commit the
transaction.  This was bad because in this particular case you could end
up with thousands and thousands of transactions being committed during
the 5 minute reproducer.  With the patch to remove this behavior you got
much more sane transaction commits, but we ended up slower because we
would write for a while, flush, write for a while, flush again.

To address this we need to reinstate a preemptive flushing mechanism.
However it is distinctly different from our ticketing flushing in that
it doesn't have tickets to base it's decisions on.  Instead of bolting
this logic into our existing flushing work, add another worker to handle
this preemptive flushing.  Here we will attempt to be slightly
intelligent about the things that we flushing, attempting to balance
between whichever pool is taking up the most space.

Subject: [PATCH 16/33] btrfs: rename need_do_async_reclaim

All of our normal flushing is asynchronous reclaim, so this helper is
poorly named.  This is more checking if we need to preemptively flush
space, so rename it to need_preemptive_reclaim.

Subject: [PATCH 18/33] btrfs: rework btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size

Currently btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size does two things, it returns
the space currently required for flushing by the tickets, and if there
are no tickets it calculates a value for the preemptive flushing.

However for the normal ticketed flushing we really only care about the
space required for tickets.  We will accidentally come in and flush one
time, but as soon as we see there are no tickets we bail out of our
flushing.

Fix this by making btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size really only tell us
what is required for flushing if we have people waiting on space.  Then
move the preemptive flushing logic into need_preemptive_reclaim().  We
ignore btrfs_calc_reclaim_metadata_size() in need_preemptive_reclaim()
because if we are in this path then we made our reservation and there
are not pending tickets currently, so we do not need to check it, simply
do the fuzzy logic to check if we're getting low on space.

Subject: [PATCH 20/33] btrfs: implement space clamping for preemptive flushing

Starting preemptive flushing at 50% of available free space is a good
start, but some workloads are particularly abusive and can quickly
overwhelm the preemptive flushing code and drive us into using tickets.

Handle this by clamping down on our threshold for starting and
continuing to run preemptive flushing.  This is particularly important
for our overcommit case, as we can really drive the file system into
overages and then it's more difficult to pull it back as we start to
actually fill up the file system.

The clamping is essentially 2^CLAMP, but we start at 1 so whatever we
calculate for overcommit is the baseline.

Subject: [PATCH 22/33] btrfs: add a trace class for dumping the current ENOSPC
 state

Often when I'm debugging ENOSPC related issues I have to resort to
printing the entire ENOSPC state with trace_printk() in different spots.
This gets pretty annoying, so add a trace state that does this for us.
Then add a trace point at the end of preemptive flushing so you can see
the state of the space_info when we decide to exit preemptive flushing.
This helped me figure out we weren't kicking in the preemptive flushing
soon enough.

Subject: [PATCH 23/33] btrfs: restart snapshot delete if we have to end the
 transaction

This is to fully fix the deadlock described in

btrfs: do not resolve backrefs for roots that are being deleted

Holding write locks on our deleted snapshot across trans handles will
just lead to sadness, and our backref lookup code is going to want to
still process dropped snapshots for things like qgroup accounting.

Fix this by simply dropping our path before we restart our transaction,
and picking back up from our drop_progress key.  This is less efficient
obviously, but it also doesn't deadlock, so it feels like a reasonable
trade off.

Subject: [PATCH 24/33] btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update
 when deleting dir entry

When we remove a directory entry, as part of an unlink operation, if the
directory was logged before we must remove the directory index items from
the log. We are also updating the inode item of the directory to update
its i_size, but that is not necessary because during log replay we do not
need it and we correctly adjust the i_size in the inode item of the
subvolume as we process directory index items and replay deletes.

This is not needed since commit d555438b6e1dad ("Btrfs: drop dir i_size
when adding new names on replay"), where we explicitly ignore the i_size
of directory inode items on log replay. Before that we used it but it
was buggy as mentioned in that commit's change log (i_size got a larger
value then it should have).

So stop updating the i_size of the directory inode item in the log, as
that is a waste of time, adds more log contention to the log tree and
often results in COWing more extent buffers for the log tree.

This code path is triggered often during dbench workloads for example.
This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update when deleting dir entry
  btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for logging
  btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
  btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when logging all parents
  btrfs: skip logging inodes already logged when logging new entries
  btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()
  btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

Performance results, after applying all patches, are mentioned in the
change log of the last patch.

Subject: [PATCH 25/33] btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for
 logging

When we fill an inode item for logging we are setting its nbytes field
with the value returned by inode_get_bytes() (a VFS API), however we do
not need it because it is not used during log replay. In fact, for fast
fsyncs, when we call inode_get_bytes() we may even get an outdated value
for nbytes because the nbytes field of the inode is only updated when
ordered extents complete, and a fast fsync only waits for writeback to
complete, it does not wait for ordered extent completion.

So just remove the setup of nbytes and add an explicit comment mentioning
why we do not set it. This also avoids adding contention on the inode's
i_lock (VFS) with concurrent stat() calls, since that spinlock is used by
inode_get_bytes() which is also called by our stat callback
(btrfs_getattr()).

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update when deleting dir entry
  btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for logging
  btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
  btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when logging all parents
  btrfs: skip logging inodes already logged when logging new entries
  btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()
  btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

Performance results, after applying all patches, are mentioned in the

Subject: [PATCH 26/33] btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging
 new inode

When we fsync a new file, created in the current transaction, we check
all its ancestor inodes and always log them if they were created in the
current transaction - even if we have already logged them before, which
is a waste of time.

So avoid logging new ancestor inodes if they were already logged before
and have no xattrs added/updated/removed since they were last logged.

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update when deleting dir entry
  btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for logging
  btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
  btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when logging all parents

  btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()
  btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

Subject: [PATCH 27/33] btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when
 logging all parents

Some times when we fsync an inode we need to do a full log of all its
ancestors (due to unlink, link or rename operations), which can be an
expensive operation, specially if the directories are large.

However if we find an ancestor directory inode that is already logged in
the current transaction, and has no inserted/updated/deleted xattrs since
it was last logged, we can skip logging the directory again. We are safe
to skip that since we know that for logged directories, any link, unlink
or rename operations that implicate the directory will update the log as
necessary.

So use the helper need_log_dir(), introduced in a previous commit, to
detect already logged directories that can be skipped.

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update when deleting dir entry
  btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for logging
  btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
  btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when logging all parents
  btrfs: skip logging inodes already logged when logging new entries
  btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()
  btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

Performance results, after applying all patches, are mentioned in the
change log of the last patch.

Subject: [PATCH 28/33] btrfs: skip logging inodes already logged when logging
 new entries

When logging new directory entries of a directory, we log the inodes of
new dentries and the inodes of dentries pointing to directories that
may have been created in past transactions. For the case of directories
we log in full mode, which can be particularly expensive for large
directories.

We do use btrfs_inode_in_log() to skip already logged inodes, however for
that helper to return true, it requires that the log transaction used to
log the inode to be already committed. This means that when we have more
than one task using the same log transaction we can end up logging an
inode multiple times, which is a waste of time and not necessary since
the log will be committed by one of the tasks and the others will wait for
the log transaction to be committed before returning to user space.

So simply replace the use of btrfs_inode_in_log() with the new helper
function need_log_inode(), introduced in a previous commit.

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update when deleting dir entry
  btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for logging
  btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
  btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when logging all parents
  btrfs: skip logging inodes already logged when logging new entries
  btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()
  btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

Performance results, after applying all patches, are mentioned in the
change log of the last patch.

Subject: [PATCH 29/33] btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()

Whenever we fsync an inode, if it is a directory, a regular file that was
created in the current transaction or has last_unlink_trans set to the
generation of the current transaction, we check if any of its ancestor
inodes (and the inode itself if it is a directory) can not be logged and
need a fallback to a full transaction commit - if so, we return with a
value of 1 in order to fallback to a transaction commit.

However we often do not need to fallback to a transaction commit because:

1) The ancestor inode is not an immediate parent, and therefore there is
   not an explicit request to log it and it is not needed neither to
   guarantee the consistency of the inode originally asked to be logged
   (fsynced) nor its immediate parent;

2) The ancestor inode was already logged before, in which case any link,
   unlink or rename operation updates the log as needed.

So for these two cases we can avoid an unnecessary transaction commit.
Therefore remove check_parent_dirs_for_sync() and add a check at the top
of btrfs_log_inode() to make us fallback immediately to a transaction
commit when we are logging a directory inode that can not be logged and
needs a full transaction commit. All we need to protect is the case where
after renaming a file someone fsyncs only the old directory, which would
result is losing the renamed file after a log replay.

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update when deleting dir entry
  btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for logging
  btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
  btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when logging all parents
  btrfs: skip logging inodes already logged when logging new entries
  btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()
  btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

Performance results, after applying all patches, are mentioned in the
change log of the last patch.

Subject: [PATCH 30/33] btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting
 for a transaction commit

Often an fsync needs to fallback to a transaction commit for several
reasons (to ensure consistency after a power failure, a new block group
was allocated or a temporary error such as ENOMEM or ENOSPC happened).

In that case the log is marked as needing a full commit and any concurrent
tasks attempting to log inodes or commit the log will also fallback to the
transaction commit. When this happens they all wait for the task that first
started the transaction commit to finish the transaction commit - however
they wait until the full transaction commit happens, which is not needed,
as they only need to wait for the superblocks to be persisted and not for
unpinning all the extents pinned during the transaction's lifetime, which
even for short lived transactions can be a few thousand and take some
significant amount of time to complete - for dbench workloads I have
observed up to 4~5 milliseconds of time spent unpinning extents in the
worst cases, and the number of pinned extents was between 2 to 3 thousand.

So allow fsync tasks to skip waiting for the unpinning of extents when
they call btrfs_commit_transaction() and they were not the task that
started the transaction commit (that one has to do it, the alternative
would be to offload the transaction commit to another task so that it
could avoid waiting for the extent unpinning or offload the extent
unpinning to another task).

This patch is part of a patchset comprised of the following patches:

  btrfs: remove unnecessary directory inode item update when deleting dir entry
  btrfs: stop setting nbytes when filling inode item for logging
  btrfs: avoid logging new ancestor inodes when logging new inode
  btrfs: skip logging directories already logged when logging all parents
  btrfs: skip logging inodes already logged when logging new entries
  btrfs: remove unnecessary check_parent_dirs_for_sync()
  btrfs: make concurrent fsyncs wait less when waiting for a transaction commit

After applying the entire patchset, dbench shows improvements in respect
to throughput and latency. The script used to measure it is the following:

  $ cat dbench-test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdk
  MNT=/mnt/sdk
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o ssd"
  MKFS_OPTIONS="-m single -d single"

  echo "performance" | tee /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor

  umount $DEV &> /dev/null
  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  dbench -D $MNT -t 300 64

  umount $MNT

The test was run on a physical machine with 12 cores (Intel corei7), 64G
of ram, using a NVMe device and a non-debug kernel configuration (Debian's
default configuration).

Subject: [PATCH 31/33] btrfs: use percpu_read_positive instead of sum_positive
 for need_preempt

Looking at perf data for a fio workload I noticed that we were spending
a pretty large chunk of time (around 5%) doing percpu_counter_sum() in
need_preemptive_reclaim.  This is silly, as we only want to know if we
have more ordered than delalloc to see if we should be counting the
delayed items in our threshold calculation.  Change this to
percpu_read_positive() to avoid the overhead.

I ran this through fsperf to validate the changes, obviously the latency
numbers in dbench and fio are quite jittery, so take them as you wish,
but overall the improvements on throughput, iops, and bw are all
positive.  Each test was run two times, the given value is the average
of both runs for their respective column.

Subject: [PATCH 32/33] btrfs: add btree read ahead for full send operations

When doing a full send we know that we are going to be reading every node
and leaf of the send root, so we benefit from enabling read ahead for the
btree.

This change enables read ahead for full send operations only, incremental
sends will have read ahead enabled in a different way by a separate patch.

The following test script was used to measure the improvement on a box
using an average, consumer grade, spinning disk and with 16Gb of ram:

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  MNT=/mnt/sdj
  MKFS_OPTIONS="--nodesize 16384"     # default, just to be explicit
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o max_inline=2048"  # default, just to be explicit

  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV > /dev/null

  # large btrees.

              local start_num=$(($start_offset + $n * $total_per_job))
              for ((i = 1; i <= $total_per_job; i++)); do
                  local file_num=$((start_num + $i))

Before this change, full send duration:

For $initial_file_count == 200000 there are 62600 nodes and leaves in the
btree of the first snapshot, while for $initial_file_count == 500000 there
are 152476 nodes and leaves. The roots were at level 2.

Subject: [PATCH 33/33] btrfs: add btree read ahead for incremental send
 operations

Currently we do not do btree read ahead when doing an incremental send,
however we know that we will read and process any node or leaf in the
send root that has a generation greater than the generation of the parent
root. So triggering read ahead for such nodes and leafs is beneficial
for an incremental send.

This change does that, triggers read ahead of any node or leaf in the
send root that has a generation greater then the generation of the
parent root. As for the parent root, no readahead is triggered because
knowing in advance which nodes/leaves are going to be read is not so
linear and there's often a large time window between visiting nodes or
leaves of the parent root. So I opted to leave out the parent root,
and triggering read ahead for its nodes/leaves seemed to have not made
significant difference.

The following test script was used to measure the improvement on a box
using an average, consumer grade, spinning disk and with 16Gb of ram:

  $ cat test.sh

              for ((i = 1; i <= $total_per_job; i++)); do
                  local file_num=$((start_num + $i))

the second snapshot. The root nodes were at level 2.

While for $initial_file_count == 500000 there are 152476 nodes and leaves
in the btree of the first snapshot, and 190511 nodes and leaves in the
btree of the second snapshot. The root nodes were at level 2 as well.
