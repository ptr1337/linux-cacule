Subject: [PATCH 5/5] blk-mq: update hctx->dispatch_busy in case of real
 scheduler

Commit 6e6fcbc27e77 ("blk-mq: support batching dispatch in case of io")
starts to support io batching submission by using hctx->dispatch_busy.

However, blk_mq_update_dispatch_busy() isn't changed to update hctx->dispatch_busy
in that commit, so fix the issue by updating hctx->dispatch_busy in case
of real scheduler.
