Subject: [PATCH 1/7] block, bfq: let also stably merged queues enjoy weight
 raising

Merged bfq_queues are kept out of weight-raising (low-latency)
mechanisms. The reason is that these queues are usually created for
non-interactive and non-soft-real-time tasks. Yet this is not the case
for stably-merged queues. These queues are merged just because they
are created shortly after each other. So they may easily serve the I/O
of an interactive or soft-real time application, if the application
happens to spawn multiple processes.

To address this issue, this commits lets also stably-merged queued
enjoy weight raising.

Subject: [PATCH 2/7] block, bfq: fix delayed stable merge check

When attempting to schedule a merge of a given bfq_queue with the currently
in-service bfq_queue or with a cooperating bfq_queue among the scheduled
bfq_queues, delayed stable merge is checked for rotational or non-queueing
devs. For this stable merge to be performed, some conditions must be met.
If the current bfq_queue underwent some split from some merged bfq_queue,
one of these conditions is that two hundred milliseconds must elapse from
split, otherwise this condition is always met.

Unfortunately, by mistake, time_is_after_jiffies() was written instead of
time_is_before_jiffies() for this check, verifying that less than two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed instead of verifying that at least two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed.

Fix this issue by replacing time_is_after_jiffies() with
time_is_before_jiffies().

Subject: [PATCH 3/7] block, bfq: consider also creation time in delayed stable
 merge

Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
queues"), BFQ may schedule a merge between a newly created sync
bfq_queue and the last sync bfq_queue created. Such a merging is not
performed immediately, because BFQ needs first to find out whether the
newly created queue actually reaches a higher throughput if not merged
at all (and in that case BFQ will not perform any stable merging). To
check that, a little time must be waited after the creation of the new
queue, so that some I/O can flow in the queue, and statistics on such
I/O can be computed.

Yet, to evaluate the above waiting time, the last split time is
considered as start time, instead of the creation time of the
queue. This is a mistake, because considering the split time is
correct only in the following scenario.

The queue undergoes a non-stable merges on the arrival of its very
first I/O request, due to close I/O with some other queue. While the
queue is merged for close I/O, stable merging is not considered. Yet
the queue may then happen to be split, if the close I/O finishes (or
happens to be a false positive). From this time on, the queue can
again be considered for stable merging. But, again, a little time must
elapse, to let some new I/O flow in the queue and to get updated
statistics. To wait for this time, the split time is to be taken into
account.

Yet, if the queue does not undergo a non-stable merge on the arrival
of its very first request, then BFQ immediately checks whether the
stable merge is to be performed. It happens because the split time for
a queue is initialized to minus infinity when the queue is created.

This commit fixes this mistake by adding the missing condition. Now
the check for delayed stable-merge is performed after a little time is
elapsed not only from the last queue split time, but also from the
creation time of the queue.

Subject: [PATCH 4/7] block, bfq: boost throughput by extending queue-merging
 times

One of the methods with which bfq boosts throughput is by merging queues.
One of the merging variants in bfq is the stable merge.
This mechanism is activated between two queues only if they are created
within a certain maximum time T1 from each other.
Merging can happen soon or be delayed. In the second case, before
merging, bfq needs to evaluate a throughput-boost parameter that
indicates whether the queue generates a high throughput is served alone.
Merging occurs when this throughput-boost is not high enough.
In particular, this parameter is evaluated and late merging may occur
only after at least a time T2 from the creation of the queue.

Currently T1 and T2 are set to 180ms and 200ms, respectively.
In this way the merging mechanism rarely occurs because time is not
enough. This results in a noticeable lowering of the overall throughput
with some workloads (see the example below).

This commit introduces two constants bfq_activation_stable_merging and
bfq_late_stable_merging in order to increase the duration of T1 and T2.
Both the stable merging activation time and the late merging
time are set to 600ms. This value has been experimentally evaluated
using sqlite benchmark in the Phoronix Test Suite on a HDD.
The duration of the benchmark before this fix was 111.02s, while now
it has reached 97.02s, a better result than that of all the other
schedulers.

Subject: [PATCH 5/7] block, bfq: avoid delayed merge of async queues
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
queues"), BFQ may schedule a merge between a newly created sync
bfq_queue, say Q2, and the last sync bfq_queue created, say Q1. To this
goal, BFQ stores the address of Q1 in the field bic->stable_merge_bfqq
of the bic associated with Q2. So, when the time for the possible merge
arrives, BFQ knows which bfq_queue to merge Q2 with. In particular,
BFQ checks for possible merges on request arrivals.

Yet the same bic may also be associated with an async bfq_queue, say
Q3. So, if a request for Q3 arrives, then the above check may happen
to be executed while the bfq_queue at hand is Q3, instead of Q2. In
this case, Q1 happens to be merged with an async bfq_queue. This is
not only a conceptual mistake, because async queues are to be kept out
of queue merging, but also a bug that leads to inconsistent states.

This commits simply filters async queues out of delayed merges.

Subject: [PATCH 6/7] block, bfq: check waker only for queues with no in-flight
 I/O

Consider two bfq_queues, say Q1 and Q2, with Q2 empty. If a request of
Q1 gets completed shortly before a new request arrives for Q2, then
BFQ flags Q1 as a candidate waker for Q2. Yet, the arrival of this new
request may have a different cause, in the following case. If also Q2
has requests in flight while waiting for the arrival of a new request,
then the completion of its own requests may be the actual cause of the
awakening of the process that sends I/O to Q2. So Q1 may be flagged
wrongly as a candidate waker.

This commit avoids this deceptive flagging, by disabling
candidate-waker flagging for Q2, if Q2 has in-flight I/O.

Subject: [PATCH 7/7] block, bfq: reset waker pointer with shared queues

Commit 85686d0dc194 ("block, bfq: keep shared queues out of the waker
mechanism") leaves shared bfq_queues out of the waker-detection
mechanism. It attains this goal by not updating the pointer
last_completed_rq_bfqq, if the last request completed belongs to a
shared bfq_queue (so that the pointer will not point to the shared
bfq_queue).

Yet this has a side effect: the pointer last_completed_rq_bfqq keeps
pointing, deceptively, to a bfq_queue that actually is not the last
one to have had a request completed. As a consequence, such a
bfq_queue may deceptively be considered as a waker of some bfq_queue,
even of some shared bfq_queue.

To address this issue, reset last_completed_rq_bfqq if the last
request completed belongs to a shared queue.
