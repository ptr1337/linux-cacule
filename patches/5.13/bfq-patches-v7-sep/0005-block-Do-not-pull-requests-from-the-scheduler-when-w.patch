Subject: [PATCH 05/15] block: Do not pull requests from the scheduler when we
 cannot dispatch them

Provided the device driver does not implement dispatch budget accounting
(which only SCSI does) the loop in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() pulls
requests from the IO scheduler as long as it is willing to give out any.
That defeats scheduling heuristics inside the scheduler by creating
false impression that the device can take more IO when it in fact
cannot.

For example with BFQ IO scheduler on top of virtio-blk device setting
blkio cgroup weight has barely any impact on observed throughput of
async IO because __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() always sucks out all the
IO queued in BFQ. BFQ first submits IO from higher weight cgroups but
when that is all dispatched, it will give out IO of lower weight cgroups
as well. And then we have to wait for all this IO to be dispatched to
the disk (which means lot of it actually has to complete) before the
IO scheduler is queried again for dispatching more requests. This
completely destroys any service differentiation.

So grab request tag for a request pulled out of the IO scheduler already
in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() and do not pull any more requests if we
cannot get it because we are unlikely to be able to dispatch it. That
way only single request is going to wait in the dispatch list for some
tag to free.
