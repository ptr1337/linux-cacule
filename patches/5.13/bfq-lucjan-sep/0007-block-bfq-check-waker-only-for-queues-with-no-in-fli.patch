Subject: [PATCH 07/24] block, bfq: check waker only for queues with no
 in-flight I/O

Consider two bfq_queues, say Q1 and Q2, with Q2 empty. If a request of
Q1 gets completed shortly before a new request arrives for Q2, then
BFQ flags Q1 as a candidate waker for Q2. Yet, the arrival of this new
request may have a different cause, in the following case. If also Q2
has requests in flight while waiting for the arrival of a new request,
then the completion of its own requests may be the actual cause of the
awakening of the process that sends I/O to Q2. So Q1 may be flagged
wrongly as a candidate waker.

This commit avoids this deceptive flagging, by disabling
candidate-waker flagging for Q2, if Q2 has in-flight I/O.
