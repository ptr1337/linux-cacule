Subject: [PATCH 6/7] ZEN: Increase max elevator name size

After renaming mq-deadline to mq-deadline-nodefault, setting the new
scheduler name would always fail.  Part of that reason was the module
alias that was fixed in "ZEN: Fix mq-deadline scheduler renaming", but
also the scheduler name was longer than ELV_NAME_MAX (by default, 15
usable characters).

Increase to 24 so we can support our longer IO scheduler names.
