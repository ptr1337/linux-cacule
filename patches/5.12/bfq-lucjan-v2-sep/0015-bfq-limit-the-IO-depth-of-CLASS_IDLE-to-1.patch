Subject: [PATCH 15/22] bfq: limit the IO depth of CLASS_IDLE to 1

The IO depth of queues belong to CLASS_IDLE is limited to 1,
so that it can avoid introducing a larger tail latency under
a device with a larger IO depth. Although limiting the IO
depth may reduce the performance of idle_class, it is
generally not a big problem, because idle_class usually does
not have strict performance requirements.
