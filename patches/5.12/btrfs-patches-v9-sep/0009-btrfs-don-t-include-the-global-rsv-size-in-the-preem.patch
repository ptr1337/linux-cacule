Subject: [PATCH 09/22] btrfs: don't include the global rsv size in the
 preemptive used amount

When deciding if we should preemptively flush space, we will add in the
amount of space used by all block rsvs.  However this also includes the
global block rsv, which isn't flushable so shouldn't be accounted for in
this calculation.  If we decide to use ->bytes_may_use in our used
calculation we need to subtract the global rsv size from this amount so
it most closely matches the flushable space.
