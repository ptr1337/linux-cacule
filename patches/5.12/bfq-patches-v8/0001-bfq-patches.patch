Subject: [PATCH 01/17] block, bfq: always inject I/O of queues blocked by
 wakers

Suppose that I/O dispatch is plugged, to wait for new I/O for the
in-service bfq-queue, say bfqq.  Suppose then that there is a further
bfq_queue woken by bfqq, and that this woken queue has pending I/O. A
woken queue does not steal bandwidth from bfqq, because it remains
soon without I/O if bfqq is not served. So there is virtually no risk
of loss of bandwidth for bfqq if this woken queue has I/O dispatched
while bfqq is waiting for new I/O. In contrast, this extra I/O
injection boosts throughput. This commit performs this extra
injection.

Subject: [PATCH 02/17] block, bfq: put reqs of waker and woken in dispatch
 list

Consider a new I/O request that arrives for a bfq_queue bfqq. If, when
this happens, the only active bfq_queues are bfqq and either its waker
bfq_queue or one of its woken bfq_queues, then there is no point in
queueing this new I/O request in bfqq for service. In fact, the
in-service queue and bfqq agree on serving this new I/O request as
soon as possible. So this commit puts this new I/O request directly
into the dispatch list.

+	 *   processes): the goal of Q1's I/O is doing what needs to
+	 *   be done so that new Q2's I/O can finally be

Subject: [PATCH 03/17] block, bfq: make shared queues inherit wakers

Consider a bfq_queue bfqq that is about to be merged with another
bfq_queue new_bfqq. The processes associated with bfqq are cooperators
of the processes associated with new_bfqq. So, if bfqq has a waker,
then it is reasonable (and beneficial for throughput) to assume that
all these processes will be happy to let bfqq's waker freely inject
I/O when they have no I/O. So this commit makes new_bfqq inherit
bfqq's waker.

 mechanism

Shared queues are likely to receive I/O at a high rate. This may
deceptively let them be considered as wakers of other queues. But a
false waker will unjustly steal bandwidth to its supposedly woken
queue. So considering also shared queues in the waking mechanism may
cause more control troubles than throughput benefits. This commit
keeps shared queues out of the waker-detection mechanism.

Subject: [PATCH 05/17] block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created queues

Many throughput-sensitive workloads are made of several parallel I/O
flows, with all flows generated by the same application, or more
generically by the same task (e.g., system boot). The most
counterproductive action with these workloads is plugging I/O dispatch
when one of the bfq_queues associated with these flows remains
temporarily empty.

To avoid this plugging, BFQ has been using a burst-handling mechanism
for years now. This mechanism has proven effective for throughput, and
not detrimental for service guarantees. This commit pushes this
mechanism a little bit further, basing on the following two facts.

First, all the I/O flows of a the same application or task contribute
to the execution/completion of that common application or task. So the
performance figures that matter are total throughput of the flows and
task-wide I/O latency.  In particular, these flows do not need to be
protected from each other, in terms of individual bandwidth or
latency.

Second, the above fact holds regardless of the number of flows.

Putting these two facts together, this commits merges stably the
bfq_queues associated with these I/O flows, i.e., with the processes
that generate these IO/ flows, regardless of how many the involved
processes are.

To decide whether a set of bfq_queues is actually associated with the
I/O flows of a common application or task, and to merge these queues
stably, this commit operates as follows: given a bfq_queue, say Q2,
currently being created, and the last bfq_queue, say Q1, created
before Q2, Q2 is merged stably with Q1 if
- very little time has elapsed since when Q1 was created
- Q2 has the same ioprio as Q1
- Q2 belongs to the same group as Q1

Merging bfq_queues also reduces scheduling overhead. A fio test with
ten random readers on /dev/nullb shows a throughput boost of 40%, with
a quadcore. Since BFQ's execution time amounts to ~50% of the total
per-request processing time, the above throughput boost implies that
BFQ's overhead is reduced by more than 50%.

+ * dispatch when one of the bfq_queues associated with these flows

+ *
+ * To avoid this plugging, BFQ has been using a burst-handling

+ * following function pushes this mechanism a little bit further,
+ * basing on the following two facts.
+ *
+ * First, all the I/O flows of a the same application or task
+ * contribute to the execution/completion of that common application
+ * or task. So the performance figures that matter are total
+ * throughput of the flows and task-wide I/O latency.  In particular,
+ * these flows do not need to be protected from each other, in terms
+ * of individual bandwidth or latency.
+ *
+ * Second, the above fact holds regardless of the number of flows.
+ *
+ * Putting these two facts together, this commits merges stably the
+ * bfq_queues associated with these I/O flows, i.e., with the
+ * processes that generate these IO/ flows, regardless of how many the
+ * involved processes are.
+ *
+ * To decide whether a set of bfq_queues is actually associated with
+ * the I/O flows of a common application or task, and to merge these
+ * queues stably, this function operates as follows: given a bfq_queue,
+ * say Q2, currently being created, and the last bfq_queue, say Q1,
+ * created before Q2, Q2 is merged stably with Q1 if
+ * - very little time has elapsed since when Q1 was created
+ * - Q2 has the same ioprio as Q1
+ * - Q2 belongs to the same group as Q1
+ *
+ * Merging bfq_queues also reduces scheduling overhead. A fio test
+ * with ten random readers on /dev/nullb shows a throughput boost of
+ * 40%, with a quadcore. Since BFQ's execution time amounts to ~50% of
+ * the total per-request processing time, the above throughput boost
+ * implies that BFQ's overhead is reduced by more than 50%.
+ *
+ * This new mechanism most certainly obsoletes the current
+ * burst-handling heuristics. We keep those heuristics for the moment.

Subject: [PATCH 06/17] bfq: silence lockdep for bfqd/ioc lock inversion

lockdep warns of circular locking due to inversion between
bfq_insert_requests and bfq_exit_icq. If we end freeing a request when
merging, we *may* grab an ioc->lock if that request is the last refcount
to that ioc. bfq_bio_merge also potentially could have this ordering.
bfq_exit_icq, conversely, grabs bfqd but is always called with ioc->lock
held.

bfq_exit_icq may either be called from put_io_context_active with ioc
refcount raised, ioc_release_fn after the last refcount was already
dropped, or ioc_clear_queue, which is only called while queue is
quiesced or exiting, so the inverted orderings should never conflict.

Fixes: aee69d78dec0 ("block, bfq: introduce the BFQ-v0 I/O scheduler as
an extra scheduler")

 passthrough request

Commit 01e99aeca39796003 ("blk-mq: insert passthrough request into
hctx->dispatch directly") gives high priority to passthrough requests and
bypass underlying IO scheduler. But as we allocate tag for such request it
still runs io-scheduler's callback limit_depth, while we really want is to
give full sbitmap-depth capabity to such request for acquiring available
tag.
blktrace shows PC requests(dmraid -s -c -i) hit bfq's limit_depth:

Subject: [PATCH 09/17] bfq/mq-deadline: remove redundant check for passthrough
 request

Since commit 01e99aeca39796003 'blk-mq: insert passthrough request into
hctx->dispatch directly', passthrough request should not appear in
IO-scheduler any more, so blk_rq_is_passthrough checking in addon IO
schedulers is redundant.

(Notes: this patch passes generic IO load test with hdds under SAS
controller and hdds under AHCI controller but obviously not covers all.
Not sure if passthrough request can still escape into IO scheduler from
blk_mq_sched_insert_requests, which is used by blk_mq_flush_plug_list and
has lots of indirect callers.)

Subject: [PATCH 10/17] block, bfq: avoid circular stable merges

BFQ may merge a new bfq_queue, stably, with the last bfq_queue
created. In particular, BFQ first waits a little bit for some I/O to
flow inside the new queue, say Q2, if this is needed to understand
whether it is better or worse to merge Q2 with the last queue created,
say Q1. This delayed stable merge is performed by assigning
bic->stable_merge_bfqq = Q1, for the bic associated with Q1.

Yet, while waiting for some I/O to flow in Q2, a non-stable queue
merge of Q2 with Q1 may happen, causing the bic previously associated
with Q2 to be associated with exactly Q1 (bic->bfqq = Q1). After that,
Q2 and Q1 may happen to be split, and, in the split, Q1 may happen to
be recycled as a non-shared bfq_queue. In that case, Q1 may then
happen to undergo a stable merge with the bfq_queue pointed by
bic->stable_merge_bfqq. Yet bic->stable_merge_bfqq still points to
Q1. So Q1 would be merged with itself.

This commit fixes this error by intercepting this situation, and
canceling the schedule of the stable merge.

Subject: [PATCH 13/17] block, bfq: fix delayed stable merge check

When attempting to schedule a merge of a given bfq_queue with the currently
in-service bfq_queue or with a cooperating bfq_queue among the scheduled
bfq_queues, delayed stable merge is checked for rotational or non-queueing
devs. For this stable merge to be performed, some conditions must be met.
If the current bfq_queue underwent some split from some merged bfq_queue,
one of these conditions is that two hundred milliseconds must elapse from
split, otherwise this condition is always met.

Unfortunately, by mistake, time_is_after_jiffies() was written instead of
time_is_before_jiffies() for this check, verifying that less than two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed instead of verifying that at least two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed.

Fix this issue by replacing time_is_after_jiffies() with
time_is_before_jiffies().
