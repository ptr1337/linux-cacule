Subject: [PATCH 19/21] xfs: set inode size after creating symlink

When XFS creates a new symlink, it writes its size to disk but not to the
VFS inode. This causes i_size_read() to return 0 for that symlink until
it is re-read from disk, for example when the system is rebooted.

I found this inconsistency while protecting directories with eCryptFS.
The command "stat path/to/symlink/in/ecryptfs" will report "Size: 0" if
the symlink was created after the last reboot on an XFS root.

Call i_size_write() in xfs_symlink()
