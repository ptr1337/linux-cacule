Subject: [PATCH 30/36] block, bfq: let also stably merged queues enjoy weight
 raising

Merged bfq_queues are kept out of weight-raising (low-latency)
mechanisms. The reason is that these queues are usually created for
non-interactive and non-soft-real-time tasks. Yet this is not the case
for stably-merged queues. These queues are merged just because they
are created shortly after each other. So they may easily serve the I/O
of an interactive or soft-real time application, if the application
happens to spawn multiple processes.

To address this issue, this commits lets also stably-merged queued
enjoy weight raising.
