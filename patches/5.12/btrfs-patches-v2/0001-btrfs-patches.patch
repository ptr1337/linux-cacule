Subject: [PATCH 01/16] btrfs: add a force_chunk_alloc to space_info's sysfs

In testing various things such as the btrfsck patch to detect over
allocation of chunks, empty block group deletion, and balance I've had
various ways to force chunk allocations for debug purposes.  Add a sysfs
file to enable forcing of chunk allocation for the owning space info in
order to enable us to add testcases in the future to test these various
features easier.

Subject: [PATCH 02/16] btrfs: do not evaluate the expression with
 !CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT

While investigating a performance issue I noticed that turning off
CONFIG_BTRFS_ASSERT had no effect in what I was seeing in perf,
specifically check_setget_bounds() was around 5% for this workload.
Upon investigation I realized that I made a mistake when I added
ASSERT(), I would still evaluate the expression, but simply ignore the
result.

This is useless, and has a marked impact on performance.  This
microbenchmark is the watered down version of an application that is
experiencing performance issues, and does renames and creates over and
over again.  Doing these operations 200k times without this patch takes
13 seconds on my machine.  With this patch it takes 7 seconds.

Subject: [PATCH 03/16] btrfs: restart snapshot delete if we have to end the
 transaction

This is to fully fix the deadlock described in

btrfs: do not resolve backrefs for roots that are being deleted

Holding write locks on our deleted snapshot across trans handles will
just lead to sadness, and our backref lookup code is going to want to
still process dropped snapshots for things like qgroup accounting.

Fix this by simply dropping our path before we restart our transaction,
and picking back up from our drop_progress key.  This is less efficient
obviously, but it also doesn't deadlock, so it feels like a reasonable
trade off.

Subject: [PATCH 04/16] btrfs: use percpu_read_positive instead of sum_positive
 for need_preempt

Looking at perf data for a fio workload I noticed that we were spending
a pretty large chunk of time (around 5%) doing percpu_counter_sum() in
need_preemptive_reclaim.  This is silly, as we only want to know if we
have more ordered than delalloc to see if we should be counting the
delayed items in our threshold calculation.  Change this to
percpu_read_positive() to avoid the overhead.

I ran this through fsperf to validate the changes, obviously the latency
numbers in dbench and fio are quite jittery, so take them as you wish,
but overall the improvements on throughput, iops, and bw are all
positive.  Each test was run two times, the given value is the average
of both runs for their respective column.

Subject: [PATCH 05/16] btrfs: add btree read ahead for full send operations

When doing a full send we know that we are going to be reading every node
and leaf of the send root, so we benefit from enabling read ahead for the
btree.

This change enables read ahead for full send operations only, incremental
sends will have read ahead enabled in a different way by a separate patch.

The following test script was used to measure the improvement on a box
using an average, consumer grade, spinning disk and with 16Gb of ram:

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdj
  MNT=/mnt/sdj
  MKFS_OPTIONS="--nodesize 16384"     # default, just to be explicit
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o max_inline=2048"  # default, just to be explicit

  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV > /dev/null
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  # Create files with inline data to make it easier and faster to create
  # large btrees.
  add_files()
  {
      local total=$1
      local start_offset=$2
      local number_jobs=$3
      local total_per_job=$(($total / $number_jobs))

      echo "Creating $total new files using $number_jobs jobs"
      for ((n = 0; n < $number_jobs; n++)); do
          (
              local start_num=$(($start_offset + $n * $total_per_job))
              for ((i = 1; i <= $total_per_job; i++)); do

Subject: [PATCH 06/16] btrfs: add btree read ahead for incremental send
 operations

Currently we do not do btree read ahead when doing an incremental send,
however we know that we will read and process any node or leaf in the
send root that has a generation greater than the generation of the parent
root. So triggering read ahead for such nodes and leafs is beneficial
for an incremental send.

This change does that, triggers read ahead of any node or leaf in the
send root that has a generation greater then the generation of the
parent root. As for the parent root, no readahead is triggered because
knowing in advance which nodes/leaves are going to be read is not so
linear and there's often a large time window between visiting nodes or
leaves of the parent root. So I opted to leave out the parent root,
and triggering read ahead for its nodes/leaves seemed to have not made
significant difference.

The following test script was used to measure the improvement on a box
using an average, consumer grade, spinning disk and with 16Gb of ram:

  $ cat test.sh
  #!/bin/bash

  DEV=/dev/sdj
  MNT=/mnt/sdj
  MKFS_OPTIONS="--nodesize 16384"     # default, just to be explicit
  MOUNT_OPTIONS="-o max_inline=2048"  # default, just to be explicit

  mkfs.btrfs -f $MKFS_OPTIONS $DEV > /dev/null
  mount $MOUNT_OPTIONS $DEV $MNT

  # Create files with inline data to make it easier and faster to create
  # large btrees.
  add_files()
  {
      local total=$1
      local start_offset=$2
      local number_jobs=$3
      local total_per_job=$(($total / $number_jobs))

      echo "Creating $total new files using $number_jobs jobs"
      for ((n = 0; n < $number_jobs; n++)); do
          (
              local start_num=$(($start_offset + $n * $total_per_job))
              for ((i = 1; i <= $total_per_job; i++)); do
                  local file_num=$((start_num + $i))
                  local file_path="$MNT/file_${file_num}"

The steps that lead to this crash are the following:

1) We are at transaction N;

2) We have two tasks with a transaction handle attached to transaction N.
   Task A and Task B. Task B is doing an fsync;

3) Task B is at btrfs_sync_log(), and has saved fs_info->log_root_tree
   into a local variable named 'log_root_tree' at the top of
   btrfs_sync_log(). Task B is about to call write_all_supers(), but
   before that...

4) Task A calls btrfs_commit_transaction(), and after it sets the
   transaction state to TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_START, an error happens before
   it waits for the transaction's 'num_writers' counter to reach a value
   of 1 (no one else attached to the transaction), so it jumps to the
   label "cleanup_transaction";

5) Task A then calls cleanup_transaction(), where it aborts the
   transaction, setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_TRANS_ABORTED on fs_info->fs_state,
   setting the ->aborted field of the transaction and the handle to an
   errno value and also setting BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR on fs_info->fs_state.

   After that, at cleanup_transaction(), it deletes the transaction from
   the list of transactions (fs_info->trans_list), sets the transaction
   to the state TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING and then waits for the number
   of writers to go down to 1, as it's currently 2 (1 for task A and 1
   for task B);

6) The transaction kthread is running and sees that BTRFS_FS_STATE_ERROR
   is set in fs_info->fs_state, so it calls btrfs_cleanup_transaction().

   There it sees the list fs_info->trans_list is empty, and then proceeds
   into calling btrfs_drop_all_logs(), which frees the log root tree with
   a call to btrfs_free_log_root_tree();

7) Task B calls write_all_supers() and, shortly after, under the label
   'out_wake_log_root', it deferences the pointer stored in
   'log_root_tree', which was already freed in the previous step by the
   transaction kthread. This results in a use-after-free leading to a
   crash.

Fix this by deleting the transaction from the list of transactions at
cleanup_transaction() only after setting the transaction state to
TRANS_STATE_COMMIT_DOING and waiting for all existing tasks that are
attached to the transaction to release their transaction handles.
This makes the transaction kthread wait for all the tasks attached to
the transaction to be done with the transaction before dropping the
log roots and doing other cleanups.

Subject: [PATCH 08/16] btrfs: return whole extents in fiemap

`xfs_io -c 'fiemap <off> <len>' <file>`
can give surprising results on btrfs that differ from xfs.

btrfs spits out extents trimmed to fit the user input. If the user's
fiemap request has an offset, then rather than returning each whole
extent which intersects that range, we also trim the start extent to not
have start < off.

Documentation in filesystems/fiemap.txt and the xfs_io man page suggests
that returning the whole extent is expected.

Some cases which all yield the same fiemap in xfs, but not btrfs:
dd if=/dev/zero of=$f bs=4k count=1
sudo xfs_io -c 'fiemap 0 1024' $f
  0: [0..7]: 26624..26631
sudo xfs_io -c 'fiemap 2048 1024' $f
  0: [4..7]: 26628..26631
sudo xfs_io -c 'fiemap 2048 4096' $f
  0: [4..7]: 26628..26631
sudo xfs_io -c 'fiemap 3584 512' $f
  0: [7..7]: 26631..26631
sudo xfs_io -c 'fiemap 4091 5' $f
  0: [7..6]: 26631..26630

I believe this is a consequence of the logic for merging contiguous
extents represented by separate extent items. That logic needs to track
the last offset as it loops through the extent items, which happens to
pick up the start offset on the first iteration, and trim off the
beginning of the full extent. To fix it, start `off` at 0 rather than
`start` so that we keep the iteration/merging intact without cutting off
the start of the extent.

after the fix, all the above commands give:
0: [0..7]: 26624..26631

The merging logic is exercised by xfstest generic/483, and I have
written a new xfstest for checking we don't have backwards or
zero-length fiemaps for cases like those above.

need_preemptive_reclaim() does some calculations, which aren't heavy,
but if we're already running preemptive reclaim there's no reason to do
them at all, so re-order the checks so that we don't do the calculation
if we're already doing reclaim.

Subject: [PATCH 10/16] btrfs: only clamp the first time we have to start
 flushing

We were clamping the threshold for preemptive reclaim any time we added
a ticket to wait on, which if we have a lot of threads means we'd
essentially max out the clamp the first time we start to flush.  Instead
of doing this, simply do it every time we have to start flushing, this
will make us ramp up gradually instead of going to max clamping as soon
as we start needing to do flushing.

Subject: [PATCH 11/16] btrfs: don't include the global rsv size in the
 preemptive used amount

When deciding if we should preemptively flush space, we will add in the
amount of space used by all block rsvs.  However this also includes the
global block rsv, which isn't flushable so shouldn't be accounted for in
this calculation.  If we decide to use ->bytes_may_use in our used
calculation we need to subtract the global rsv size from this amount so
it most closely matches the flushable space.

We calculate the amount of "free" space available for normal
reservations by taking the total space and subtracting out the hard used
space, which is readonly, used, and reserved space.  However we weren't
taking into account the global block rsv, which is essentially hard used
space.  Handle this by subtracting it from the available free space, so
that our threshold more closely mirrors reality.

Subject: [PATCH 14/16] btrfs: only ignore delalloc if delalloc is much smaller
 than ordered

While testing heavy delalloc workloads I noticed that sometimes we'd
just stop preemptively flushing when we had loads of delalloc available
to flush.  This is because we skip preemptive flushing if delalloc <=
ordered.  However if we start with say 4gib of delalloc, and we flush
2gib of that, we'll stop flushing there, when we still have 2gib of
delalloc to flush.

Instead adjust the ordered bytes down by half, this way if 2/3 of our
outstanding delalloc reservations are tied up by ordered extents we
don't bother preemptive flushing, as we're getting close to the state
where we need to wait on ordered extents.

 differently

If we decide to flush delalloc from the preemptive flusher, we really do
not want to wait on ordered extents, as it gains us nothing.  However
there was logic to go ahead and wait on ordered extents if there was
more ordered bytes than delalloc bytes.  We do not want this behavior,
so pass through whether this flushing is for preemption, and do not wait
for ordered extents if that's the case.  Also break out of the shrink
loop after the first flushing, as we just want to one shot shrink
delalloc.

Subject: [PATCH 16/16] btrfs: avoid RCU stalls while running delayed iputs

Generally a delayed iput is added when we might do the final iput, so
usually we'll end up sleeping while processing the delayed iputs
naturally.  However there's no guarantee of this, especially for small
files.  In production we noticed 5 instances of RCU stalls while testing
a kernel release overnight across 1000 machines, so this is relatively
common.

Fix this by adding a cond_resched_lock() to the loop processing delayed
iputs so we can avoid these sort of stalls.
