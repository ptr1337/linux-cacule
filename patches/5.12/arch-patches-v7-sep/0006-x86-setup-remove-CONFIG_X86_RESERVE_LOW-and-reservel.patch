Subject: [PATCH 6/7] x86/setup: remove CONFIG_X86_RESERVE_LOW and reservelow
 options

The CONFIG_X86_RESERVE_LOW build time and reservelow command line option
allowed to control the amount of memory under 1M that would be reserved at
boot to avoid using memory that can be potentially clobbered by BIOS.

Since the entire range under 1M is always reserved there is no need for
these options and they can be removed.

-	  The first page contains BIOS data structures that the kernel

-
-	  By default we reserve the first 64K of physical RAM, as a
-	  number of BIOSes are known to corrupt that memory range
-	  during events such as suspend/resume or monitor cable
-	  insertion, so it must not be used by the kernel.
-
-	  You can set this to 4 if you are absolutely sure that you
-	  trust the BIOS to get all its memory reservations and usages
-	  right.  If you know your BIOS have problems beyond the
