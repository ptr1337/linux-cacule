Subject: [PATCH 01/36] block, bfq: always inject I/O of queues blocked by
 wakers

Suppose that I/O dispatch is plugged, to wait for new I/O for the
in-service bfq-queue, say bfqq.  Suppose then that there is a further
bfq_queue woken by bfqq, and that this woken queue has pending I/O. A
woken queue does not steal bandwidth from bfqq, because it remains
soon without I/O if bfqq is not served. So there is virtually no risk
of loss of bandwidth for bfqq if this woken queue has I/O dispatched
while bfqq is waiting for new I/O. In contrast, this extra I/O
injection boosts throughput. This commit performs this extra
injection.

Subject: [PATCH 02/36] block, bfq: put reqs of waker and woken in dispatch
 list

Consider a new I/O request that arrives for a bfq_queue bfqq. If, when
this happens, the only active bfq_queues are bfqq and either its waker
bfq_queue or one of its woken bfq_queues, then there is no point in
queueing this new I/O request in bfqq for service. In fact, the
in-service queue and bfqq agree on serving this new I/O request as
soon as possible. So this commit puts this new I/O request directly
into the dispatch list.

Subject: [PATCH 03/36] block, bfq: make shared queues inherit wakers

Consider a bfq_queue bfqq that is about to be merged with another
bfq_queue new_bfqq. The processes associated with bfqq are cooperators
of the processes associated with new_bfqq. So, if bfqq has a waker,
then it is reasonable (and beneficial for throughput) to assume that
all these processes will be happy to let bfqq's waker freely inject
I/O when they have no I/O. So this commit makes new_bfqq inherit
bfqq's waker.

Shared queues are likely to receive I/O at a high rate. This may
deceptively let them be considered as wakers of other queues. But a
false waker will unjustly steal bandwidth to its supposedly woken
queue. So considering also shared queues in the waking mechanism may
cause more control troubles than throughput benefits. This commit
keeps shared queues out of the waker-detection mechanism.

Subject: [PATCH 05/36] block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created queues

Many throughput-sensitive workloads are made of several parallel I/O
flows, with all flows generated by the same application, or more
generically by the same task (e.g., system boot). The most
counterproductive action with these workloads is plugging I/O dispatch
when one of the bfq_queues associated with these flows remains
temporarily empty.

To avoid this plugging, BFQ has been using a burst-handling mechanism
for years now. This mechanism has proven effective for throughput, and
not detrimental for service guarantees. This commit pushes this
mechanism a little bit further, basing on the following two facts.

First, all the I/O flows of a the same application or task contribute
to the execution/completion of that common application or task. So the
performance figures that matter are total throughput of the flows and
task-wide I/O latency.  In particular, these flows do not need to be
protected from each other, in terms of individual bandwidth or
latency.

Second, the above fact holds regardless of the number of flows.

Putting these two facts together, this commits merges stably the
bfq_queues associated with these I/O flows, i.e., with the processes
that generate these IO/ flows, regardless of how many the involved
processes are.

To decide whether a set of bfq_queues is actually associated with the
I/O flows of a common application or task, and to merge these queues
stably, this commit operates as follows: given a bfq_queue, say Q2,
currently being created, and the last bfq_queue, say Q1, created
before Q2, Q2 is merged stably with Q1 if
- very little time has elapsed since when Q1 was created
- Q2 has the same ioprio as Q1
- Q2 belongs to the same group as Q1

Merging bfq_queues also reduces scheduling overhead. A fio test with
ten random readers on /dev/nullb shows a throughput boost of 40%, with
a quadcore. Since BFQ's execution time amounts to ~50% of the total
per-request processing time, the above throughput boost implies that
BFQ's overhead is reduced by more than 50%.

+ * dispatch when one of the bfq_queues associated with these flows

+ *
+ * To avoid this plugging, BFQ has been using a burst-handling

+ * following function pushes this mechanism a little bit further,
+ * basing on the following two facts.
+ *
+ * First, all the I/O flows of a the same application or task
+ * contribute to the execution/completion of that common application
+ * or task. So the performance figures that matter are total
+ * throughput of the flows and task-wide I/O latency.  In particular,
+ * these flows do not need to be protected from each other, in terms
+ * of individual bandwidth or latency.
+ *
+ * Second, the above fact holds regardless of the number of flows.
+ *
+ * Putting these two facts together, this commits merges stably the
+ * bfq_queues associated with these I/O flows, i.e., with the
+ * processes that generate these IO/ flows, regardless of how many the
+ * involved processes are.
+ *
+ * To decide whether a set of bfq_queues is actually associated with
+ * the I/O flows of a common application or task, and to merge these
+ * queues stably, this function operates as follows: given a bfq_queue,
+ * say Q2, currently being created, and the last bfq_queue, say Q1,
+ * created before Q2, Q2 is merged stably with Q1 if
+ * - very little time has elapsed since when Q1 was created
+ * - Q2 has the same ioprio as Q1
+ * - Q2 belongs to the same group as Q1
+ *
+ * Merging bfq_queues also reduces scheduling overhead. A fio test
+ * with ten random readers on /dev/nullb shows a throughput boost of
+ * 40%, with a quadcore. Since BFQ's execution time amounts to ~50% of
+ * the total per-request processing time, the above throughput boost
+ * implies that BFQ's overhead is reduced by more than 50%.
+ *
+ * This new mechanism most certainly obsoletes the current
+ * burst-handling heuristics. We keep those heuristics for the moment.

Subject: [PATCH 06/36] bfq: silence lockdep for bfqd/ioc lock inversion

lockdep warns of circular locking due to inversion between
bfq_insert_requests and bfq_exit_icq. If we end freeing a request when
merging, we *may* grab an ioc->lock if that request is the last refcount
to that ioc. bfq_bio_merge also potentially could have this ordering.
bfq_exit_icq, conversely, grabs bfqd but is always called with ioc->lock
held.

bfq_exit_icq may either be called from put_io_context_active with ioc
refcount raised, ioc_release_fn after the last refcount was already
dropped, or ioc_clear_queue, which is only called while queue is
quiesced or exiting, so the inverted orderings should never conflict.

Fixes: aee69d78dec0 ("block, bfq: introduce the BFQ-v0 I/O scheduler as
an extra scheduler")

 passthrough request

Commit 01e99aeca39796003 ("blk-mq: insert passthrough request into
hctx->dispatch directly") gives high priority to passthrough requests and
bypass underlying IO scheduler. But as we allocate tag for such request it
still runs io-scheduler's callback limit_depth, while we really want is to
give full sbitmap-depth capabity to such request for acquiring available
tag.
blktrace shows PC requests(dmraid -s -c -i) hit bfq's limit_depth:

Subject: [PATCH 09/36] bfq/mq-deadline: remove redundant check for passthrough
 request

Since commit 01e99aeca39796003 'blk-mq: insert passthrough request into
hctx->dispatch directly', passthrough request should not appear in
IO-scheduler any more, so blk_rq_is_passthrough checking in addon IO
schedulers is redundant.

(Notes: this patch passes generic IO load test with hdds under SAS
controller and hdds under AHCI controller but obviously not covers all.
Not sure if passthrough request can still escape into IO scheduler from
blk_mq_sched_insert_requests, which is used by blk_mq_flush_plug_list and
has lots of indirect callers.)

Subject: [PATCH 10/36] block, bfq: avoid circular stable merges

BFQ may merge a new bfq_queue, stably, with the last bfq_queue
created. In particular, BFQ first waits a little bit for some I/O to
flow inside the new queue, say Q2, if this is needed to understand
whether it is better or worse to merge Q2 with the last queue created,
say Q1. This delayed stable merge is performed by assigning
bic->stable_merge_bfqq = Q1, for the bic associated with Q1.

Yet, while waiting for some I/O to flow in Q2, a non-stable queue
merge of Q2 with Q1 may happen, causing the bic previously associated
with Q2 to be associated with exactly Q1 (bic->bfqq = Q1). After that,
Q2 and Q1 may happen to be split, and, in the split, Q1 may happen to
be recycled as a non-shared bfq_queue. In that case, Q1 may then
happen to undergo a stable merge with the bfq_queue pointed by
bic->stable_merge_bfqq. Yet bic->stable_merge_bfqq still points to
Q1. So Q1 would be merged with itself.

This commit fixes this error by intercepting this situation, and
canceling the schedule of the stable merge.

Subject: [PATCH 13/36] block, bfq: fix delayed stable merge check

When attempting to schedule a merge of a given bfq_queue with the currently
in-service bfq_queue or with a cooperating bfq_queue among the scheduled
bfq_queues, delayed stable merge is checked for rotational or non-queueing
devs. For this stable merge to be performed, some conditions must be met.
If the current bfq_queue underwent some split from some merged bfq_queue,
one of these conditions is that two hundred milliseconds must elapse from
split, otherwise this condition is always met.

Unfortunately, by mistake, time_is_after_jiffies() was written instead of
time_is_before_jiffies() for this check, verifying that less than two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed instead of verifying that at least two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed.

Fix this issue by replacing time_is_after_jiffies() with
time_is_before_jiffies().

Subject: [PATCH 18/36] bfq: Remove merged request already in
 bfq_requests_merged()

Currently, bfq does very little in bfq_requests_merged() and handles all
the request cleanup in bfq_finish_requeue_request() called from
blk_mq_free_request(). That is currently safe only because
blk_mq_free_request() is called shortly after bfq_requests_merged()
while bfqd->lock is still held. However to fix a lock inversion between
bfqd->lock and ioc->lock, we need to call blk_mq_free_request() after
dropping bfqd->lock. That would mean that already merged request could
be seen by other processes inside bfq queues and possibly dispatched to
the device which is wrong. So move cleanup of the request from
bfq_finish_requeue_request() to bfq_requests_merged().

Subject: [PATCH 19/36] blk: Fix lock inversion between ioc lock and bfqd lock

Lockdep complains about lock inversion between ioc->lock and bfqd->lock:

bfqd -> ioc:
 put_io_context+0x33/0x90 -> ioc->lock grabbed
 blk_mq_free_request+0x51/0x140
 blk_put_request+0xe/0x10
 blk_attempt_req_merge+0x1d/0x30
 elv_attempt_insert_merge+0x56/0xa0
 blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge+0x4b/0x60
 bfq_insert_requests+0x9e/0x18c0 -> bfqd->lock grabbed
 blk_mq_sched_insert_requests+0xd6/0x2b0
 blk_mq_flush_plug_list+0x154/0x280
 blk_finish_plug+0x40/0x60
 ext4_writepages+0x696/0x1320
 do_writepages+0x1c/0x80
 __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xd7/0x120
 sync_file_range+0xac/0xf0

ioc->bfqd:
 bfq_exit_icq+0xa3/0xe0 -> bfqd->lock grabbed
 put_io_context_active+0x78/0xb0 -> ioc->lock grabbed
 exit_io_context+0x48/0x50
 do_exit+0x7e9/0xdd0
 do_group_exit+0x54/0xc0

To avoid this inversion we change blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge() to not
free the merged request but rather leave that upto the caller similarly
to blk_mq_sched_try_merge(). And in bfq_insert_requests() we make sure
to free all the merged requests after dropping bfqd->lock.

Fixes: aee69d78dec0 ("block, bfq: introduce the BFQ-v0 I/O scheduler as an extra scheduler")

Subject: [PATCH 22/36] bfq: Remove merged request already in
 bfq_requests_merged()

Currently, bfq does very little in bfq_requests_merged() and handles all
the request cleanup in bfq_finish_requeue_request() called from
blk_mq_free_request(). That is currently safe only because
blk_mq_free_request() is called shortly after bfq_requests_merged()
while bfqd->lock is still held. However to fix a lock inversion between
bfqd->lock and ioc->lock, we need to call blk_mq_free_request() after
dropping bfqd->lock. That would mean that already merged request could
be seen by other processes inside bfq queues and possibly dispatched to
the device which is wrong. So move cleanup of the request from
bfq_finish_requeue_request() to bfq_requests_merged().

Subject: [PATCH 23/36] blk: Fix lock inversion between ioc lock and bfqd lock

Lockdep complains about lock inversion between ioc->lock and bfqd->lock:

bfqd -> ioc:
 put_io_context+0x33/0x90 -> ioc->lock grabbed
 blk_mq_free_request+0x51/0x140
 blk_put_request+0xe/0x10
 blk_attempt_req_merge+0x1d/0x30
 elv_attempt_insert_merge+0x56/0xa0
 blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge+0x4b/0x60
 bfq_insert_requests+0x9e/0x18c0 -> bfqd->lock grabbed
 blk_mq_sched_insert_requests+0xd6/0x2b0
 blk_mq_flush_plug_list+0x154/0x280
 blk_finish_plug+0x40/0x60
 ext4_writepages+0x696/0x1320
 do_writepages+0x1c/0x80
 __filemap_fdatawrite_range+0xd7/0x120
 sync_file_range+0xac/0xf0

ioc->bfqd:
 bfq_exit_icq+0xa3/0xe0 -> bfqd->lock grabbed
 put_io_context_active+0x78/0xb0 -> ioc->lock grabbed
 exit_io_context+0x48/0x50
 do_exit+0x7e9/0xdd0
 do_group_exit+0x54/0xc0

To avoid this inversion we change blk_mq_sched_try_insert_merge() to not
free the merged request but rather leave that upto the caller similarly
to blk_mq_sched_try_merge(). And in bfq_insert_requests() we make sure
to free all the merged requests after dropping bfqd->lock.

Subject: [PATCH 25/36] block: Do not pull requests from the scheduler when we
 cannot dispatch them

Provided the device driver does not implement dispatch budget accounting
(which only SCSI does) the loop in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() pulls
requests from the IO scheduler as long as it is willing to give out any.
That defeats scheduling heuristics inside the scheduler by creating
false impression that the device can take more IO when it in fact
cannot.

For example with BFQ IO scheduler on top of virtio-blk device setting
blkio cgroup weight has barely any impact on observed throughput of
async IO because __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() always sucks out all the
IO queued in BFQ. BFQ first submits IO from higher weight cgroups but
when that is all dispatched, it will give out IO of lower weight cgroups
as well. And then we have to wait for all this IO to be dispatched to
the disk (which means lot of it actually has to complete) before the
IO scheduler is queried again for dispatching more requests. This
completely destroys any service differentiation.

So grab request tag for a request pulled out of the IO scheduler already
in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() and do not pull any more requests if we
cannot get it because we are unlikely to be able to dispatch it. That
way only single request is going to wait in the dispatch list for some
tag to free.

Subject: [PATCH 27/36] block: Do not pull requests from the scheduler when we
 cannot dispatch them

Provided the device driver does not implement dispatch budget accounting
(which only SCSI does) the loop in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() pulls
requests from the IO scheduler as long as it is willing to give out any.
That defeats scheduling heuristics inside the scheduler by creating
false impression that the device can take more IO when it in fact
cannot.

For example with BFQ IO scheduler on top of virtio-blk device setting
blkio cgroup weight has barely any impact on observed throughput of
async IO because __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() always sucks out all the
IO queued in BFQ. BFQ first submits IO from higher weight cgroups but
when that is all dispatched, it will give out IO of lower weight cgroups
as well. And then we have to wait for all this IO to be dispatched to
the disk (which means lot of it actually has to complete) before the
IO scheduler is queried again for dispatching more requests. This
completely destroys any service differentiation.

So grab request tag for a request pulled out of the IO scheduler already
in __blk_mq_do_dispatch_sched() and do not pull any more requests if we
cannot get it because we are unlikely to be able to dispatch it. That
way only single request is going to wait in the dispatch list for some
tag to free.

Subject: [PATCH 30/36] block, bfq: let also stably merged queues enjoy weight
 raising

Merged bfq_queues are kept out of weight-raising (low-latency)
mechanisms. The reason is that these queues are usually created for
non-interactive and non-soft-real-time tasks. Yet this is not the case
for stably-merged queues. These queues are merged just because they
are created shortly after each other. So they may easily serve the I/O
of an interactive or soft-real time application, if the application
happens to spawn multiple processes.

To address this issue, this commits lets also stably-merged queued
enjoy weight raising.

Subject: [PATCH 31/36] block, bfq: fix delayed stable merge check

When attempting to schedule a merge of a given bfq_queue with the currently
in-service bfq_queue or with a cooperating bfq_queue among the scheduled
bfq_queues, delayed stable merge is checked for rotational or non-queueing
devs. For this stable merge to be performed, some conditions must be met.
If the current bfq_queue underwent some split from some merged bfq_queue,
one of these conditions is that two hundred milliseconds must elapse from
split, otherwise this condition is always met.

Unfortunately, by mistake, time_is_after_jiffies() was written instead of
time_is_before_jiffies() for this check, verifying that less than two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed instead of verifying that at least two
hundred milliseconds have elapsed.

Fix this issue by replacing time_is_after_jiffies() with
time_is_before_jiffies().

Subject: [PATCH 32/36] block, bfq: consider also creation time in delayed
 stable merge

Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
queues"), BFQ may schedule a merge between a newly created sync
bfq_queue and the last sync bfq_queue created. Such a merging is not
performed immediately, because BFQ needs first to find out whether the
newly created queue actually reaches a higher throughput if not merged
at all (and in that case BFQ will not perform any stable merging). To
check that, a little time must be waited after the creation of the new
queue, so that some I/O can flow in the queue, and statistics on such
I/O can be computed.

Yet, to evaluate the above waiting time, the last split time is
considered as start time, instead of the creation time of the
queue. This is a mistake, because considering the split time is
correct only in the following scenario.

The queue undergoes a non-stable merges on the arrival of its very
first I/O request, due to close I/O with some other queue. While the
queue is merged for close I/O, stable merging is not considered. Yet
the queue may then happen to be split, if the close I/O finishes (or
happens to be a false positive). From this time on, the queue can
again be considered for stable merging. But, again, a little time must
elapse, to let some new I/O flow in the queue and to get updated
statistics. To wait for this time, the split time is to be taken into
account.

Yet, if the queue does not undergo a non-stable merge on the arrival
of its very first request, then BFQ immediately checks whether the
stable merge is to be performed. It happens because the split time for
a queue is initialized to minus infinity when the queue is created.

This commit fixes this mistake by adding the missing condition. Now
the check for delayed stable-merge is performed after a little time is
elapsed not only from the last queue split time, but also from the
creation time of the queue.

Subject: [PATCH 33/36] block, bfq: boost throughput by extending queue-merging
 times

One of the methods with which bfq boosts throughput is by merging queues.
One of the merging variants in bfq is the stable merge.
This mechanism is activated between two queues only if they are created
within a certain maximum time T1 from each other.
Merging can happen soon or be delayed. In the second case, before
merging, bfq needs to evaluate a throughput-boost parameter that
indicates whether the queue generates a high throughput is served alone.
Merging occurs when this throughput-boost is not high enough.
In particular, this parameter is evaluated and late merging may occur
only after at least a time T2 from the creation of the queue.

Currently T1 and T2 are set to 180ms and 200ms, respectively.
In this way the merging mechanism rarely occurs because time is not
enough. This results in a noticeable lowering of the overall throughput
with some workloads (see the example below).

This commit introduces two constants bfq_activation_stable_merging and
bfq_late_stable_merging in order to increase the duration of T1 and T2.
Both the stable merging activation time and the late merging
time are set to 600ms. This value has been experimentally evaluated
using sqlite benchmark in the Phoronix Test Suite on a HDD.
The duration of the benchmark before this fix was 111.02s, while now
it has reached 97.02s, a better result than that of all the other
schedulers.

Subject: [PATCH 34/36] block, bfq: avoid delayed merge of async queues
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8
Content-Transfer-Encoding: 8bit

Since commit 430a67f9d616 ("block, bfq: merge bursts of newly-created
queues"), BFQ may schedule a merge between a newly created sync
bfq_queue, say Q2, and the last sync bfq_queue created, say Q1. To this
goal, BFQ stores the address of Q1 in the field bic->stable_merge_bfqq
of the bic associated with Q2. So, when the time for the possible merge
arrives, BFQ knows which bfq_queue to merge Q2 with. In particular,
BFQ checks for possible merges on request arrivals.

Yet the same bic may also be associated with an async bfq_queue, say
Q3. So, if a request for Q3 arrives, then the above check may happen
to be executed while the bfq_queue at hand is Q3, instead of Q2. In
this case, Q1 happens to be merged with an async bfq_queue. This is
not only a conceptual mistake, because async queues are to be kept out
of queue merging, but also a bug that leads to inconsistent states.

This commits simply filters async queues out of delayed merges.

Subject: [PATCH 35/36] block, bfq: check waker only for queues with no
 in-flight I/O

Consider two bfq_queues, say Q1 and Q2, with Q2 empty. If a request of
Q1 gets completed shortly before a new request arrives for Q2, then
BFQ flags Q1 as a candidate waker for Q2. Yet, the arrival of this new
request may have a different cause, in the following case. If also Q2
has requests in flight while waiting for the arrival of a new request,
then the completion of its own requests may be the actual cause of the
awakening of the process that sends I/O to Q2. So Q1 may be flagged
wrongly as a candidate waker.

This commit avoids this deceptive flagging, by disabling
candidate-waker flagging for Q2, if Q2 has in-flight I/O.

Subject: [PATCH 36/36] block, bfq: reset waker pointer with shared queues

Commit 85686d0dc194 ("block, bfq: keep shared queues out of the waker
mechanism") leaves shared bfq_queues out of the waker-detection
mechanism. It attains this goal by not updating the pointer
last_completed_rq_bfqq, if the last request completed belongs to a
shared bfq_queue (so that the pointer will not point to the shared
bfq_queue).

Yet this has a side effect: the pointer last_completed_rq_bfqq keeps
pointing, deceptively, to a bfq_queue that actually is not the last
one to have had a request completed. As a consequence, such a
bfq_queue may deceptively be considered as a waker of some bfq_queue,
even of some shared bfq_queue.

To address this issue, reset last_completed_rq_bfqq if the last
request completed belongs to a shared queue.
