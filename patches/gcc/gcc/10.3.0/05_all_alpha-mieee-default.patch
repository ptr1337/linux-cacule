Set the default behavior on alpha to use -mieee since the large majority of
time we want this (bad/weird things can happen with packages built without
it).

To satisfy those people who may not want -mieee forced on them all the time,
we also provide -mno-ieee.

Patch by Mike Frysinger <vapier@gentoo.org>

Note: upstream doesn't want to take this due to long standing behavior, and
because it'd make behavior across OS's inconsistent:
	https://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc-patches/2003-07/msg02144.html

This makes sense for upstream, but Gentoo is more concerned about packages
behaving the same across arches under Linux.
