# Linux-Cacule Kernels for several architectures (armv7/aarch64 and x86_64)

## General Informations

    - Linux-cacule is the stable kernel
    - The linux-cacule-rdb is still a expermiental kernel.At the moment not maintained, needs to be updated
    - Follow the readme, the sysctl options can improve much your expierence!!!

### amd64 /  x86_64

    # Linux 5.13.y
        - linux-cacule                         https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-cacule/
        - linux-cacule-rdb                     https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-cacule-rdb/
    # Linux 5.12.y
        - linux-hardened-cacule                https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-hardened-cacule/
    # Linux 5.14-rc
        - linux-cacule-rc                      https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-cacule-rc/
        - linux-cacule-rdb-rc                  https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-cacule-rdb-rc/

 ### RT-KERNELS

    Ã¤ linux-xanmod-cacule-rt 5.11.y             https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-cacule-rt/
    # linux-xanmod-cacule-rt 5.10.y             https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-xanmod-cacule-rt-stable/


- When building the kernel, you can edit the PKGBUILD to your prefences regarding the user specific wishes
- Also at building the kernel, you will be asked for some things like your cpu architecture, disabling debug settings for better performance, ...

### aarch64/armv7h

    # Linux 5.11.y
        - linux-raspberrypi4-cacule-stable      https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-raspberrypi4-cacule-stable/
    # Linux 5.10.y
        - linux-raspberrypi4-cacule             https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/linux-raspberrypi4-cacule/


#### Some infos for building  arm devices:
    -  it is automaticly collecting your architecture, so you can use the pkgbuild for armv7h/aarch64 without changes
    -  All kernels are tested and working


## General Informations

### Tips & Tricks:

You can tune the scheduler with following commands:

## prebuilt Kernels

Im providing a fileserver where i upload my builded kernels - Skylake and Generic and v3 ones.

##  more explained Informations for the cacule scheduler

Here you find the repo from the creator of the scheduler:

https://github.com/hamadmarri/cacule-cpu-scheduler

## CacULE revision 2 - testing Changes:

- Added 2000HZ as an option
- Added Responsive wakup/new task to be placed in a CPU with least Interactive score (to balance out interactive tasks among cpus)
- Added Interactivity levels mechanism
- Increased the precision of lifetime normalize from x8 to x1024
- Decoupled se.vruntime from cn.vruntime
